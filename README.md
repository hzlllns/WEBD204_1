WEBD204_1: Grocery List
=========

An interactive grocery list created for my RIA Dev 2 class. 

## The brief:Using JavaScript Objects, create a to-do list (or creative variation of). The to-do list should be able to store locally, and be added to. You should also be able to delete a task. Onceyou have those basics going, feel free to expand on your to-do task by adding assignment (i.e. who is responsible for the task) and deadlines.
